# Transaction

# Consistance

# SQL DB Design

# CAP Theorem

- Consistancy

Every read receives the most recent write or error.

- Availability

Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

- Partition Tolerance

The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

# ACID

ACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.

- Atomicity

Each transaction is all or nothing

- Consistency

Any transactions will bring the database from one valid state to another.

- Isolation

Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially

- Durability

Once a transsaction has been committed, it will remain no.
